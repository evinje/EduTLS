SSL/TLS is the most common and widely used secure protocol in Internet. It is a package
of more than 30 cryptographic primitives and protocols. For students studying information
security it is of a crucial importance to have a good understanding of how the different
parts are working. The aim of the project will be to develop an educational implementation
of SSL/TLS that could be used when teaching information security. The basic idea is to
create a simple protocol that encrypts communication between two hosts, implemented in 
Java. The protocol should include implementations of DH, RSA, AES and SHA-1 accompanied 
by a graphical interface that will monitor what is happening in every moment of the work 
of the algorithm (protocol). The graphical user interface should also include statistics 
on how time consuming each operation has been.
